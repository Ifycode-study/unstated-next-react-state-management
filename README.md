# Managing State in React using Unstated-Next

From the CSS tricks article: [Managing State in React using Unstated-Next](https://css-tricks.com/managing-state-in-react-using-unstated-next/).

> Note 1: The minimal form component example should use <FormContainer.Provider> and not <Form.Provider>. See [unstated-next readme example](https://www.npmjs.com/package/unstated-next).

> Note 2: For the sharing state across multiple components example, I changed my file/folder structure and component  names.
